### Python functions for easily implementing psychoacoustic experimentations

The functions and their documentation are in "psychoacoustics_functions.py".

As an instance of the functions in action, look into "example_masking_experiment.py"; an implemented masking experiment.

More functions and experimentations will soon be added to this repository.

In case of any issues, questions or suggestions, please email me.
